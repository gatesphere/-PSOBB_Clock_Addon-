# PSOBB Clock Addon
Clock Addon for Phantasy Star Online: Blue Burst

## Requirements
Requires the PSOBBMod Plugin.  I recommend Solybum's updated version, here: https://github.com/Solybum/psobbaddonplugin/releases/tag/v0.3.5.4

## Installation
Copy the Clock directory into your addons/ folder.

## Use
Options:

 - Enable: enable or disable the FPS window
 - Use 24 Hour Time: enable or disable 24-hour or 12-hour time
 - Show seconds: enable or disable the display of the current second
 - Show .beats: enable or disable the display of internet time
 
 To show the configuration window again, use the "Clock" button in the PSOBBMod Main Menu.

## Note
The internet time (.beats) value is based on your current system clock.  It may not exactly equal the time displayed by the PSOBB client in the menus, but it should be close enough for government work.
